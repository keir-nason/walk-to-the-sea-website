The Old State House has been witness to many protests and acts of resistance since its construction. March of 2020 was the 250th anniversary of the Boston Massacre of 1770, where British soldiers opened fire on a crowd of protestors. Five men were killed, and the resulting backlash helped lead to the American Revolution. June of that same year saw another anniversary pass by, commemorating an act of protest that led to a tradition of activism persisting to this day; the 50th anniversary of Boston’s first Pride demonstration, which passed right by the Old State House. Though the COVID pandemic left little time to celebrate at the time, the anniversary of a landmark moment in LGBT history deserves still deserves time in the sun.  

# Boston and Stonewall

On June 28th of 1969, the LGBT community of New York City staged a series of protests in the neighborhood of Greenwich Village. With the community's anger focused on a police raid of the Stonewall Inn (where these protests would later take their name) and general mistreatment by law enforcement, demonstrations would continue throughout most of the day and set an example for LGBT activism that would not stay local for long. 

Organizers in Boston chose June of the following year to demonstrate, in honor of Stonewall. A group of participants across Boston’s LGBT organizations marched from Cambridge Common to Boston Common in what they called Christopher Street Liberation, after the street on which Stonewall was located. This demonstration was incredibly small, with the 50 or so marchers facing a very real threat of police intervention, but the spark set at Stonewall had found tinder.

While this was not quite the Pride March one might expect today, Christopher Street Liberation helped blaze the trail for future events. Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco would also host events that same year, and the organizers of 1970’s Christopher Street event would continue to plan marches and demonstrations in the area. In one short year, the LGBT community had taken great strides in building an activism network.
