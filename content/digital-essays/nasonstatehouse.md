The Old State House has been witness to many protests and acts of resistance since its construction. March of 2020 was the 250th anniversary of the Boston Massacre of 1770, where British soldiers opened fire on a crowd of protestors. Five men were killed, and the resulting backlash helped lead to the American Revolution. June of that same year saw another anniversary pass by, commemorating an act of protest that led to a tradition of activism persisting to this day; the 50th anniversary of Boston’s first Pride demonstration, which passed right by the Old State House. Though the COVID pandemic left little time to celebrate at the time, the anniversary of a landmark moment in LGBT history deserves still deserves time in the sun.  

# Boston and Stonewall

On June 28th of 1969, the LGBT community of New York City staged a series of protests in the neighborhood of Greenwich Village. With the community's anger focused on a police raid of the Stonewall Inn (where these protests would later take their name) and general mistreatment by law enforcement, demonstrations would continue throughout most of the day and set an example for LGBT activism that would not stay local for long. 

Organizers in Boston chose June of the following year to demonstrate, in honor of Stonewall. A group of participants across Boston’s LGBT organizations marched from Cambridge Common to Boston Common in what they called Christopher Street Liberation, after the street on which Stonewall was located. This demonstration was incredibly small, with the 50 or so marchers facing a very real threat of police intervention, but the spark set at Stonewall had found tinder.

While this was not quite the Pride March one might expect today, Christopher Street Liberation helped blaze the trail for future events. Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco would also host events that same year, and the organizers of 1970’s Christopher Street event would continue to plan marches and demonstrations in the area. In one short year, the LGBT community had taken great strides in building an activism network. 

# The First Pride March

The following year saw the first officially dubbed Pride March in Boston. 300 people marched across the city, on a pre-planned path taking them from drag bars to cathedrals and the seat of the state government. The march was organized, intended to push for political goals and show that Boston’s LGBT community were united in working for them. At each location, the group would stop and read from a list of demands. Conditions for lesbian patrons at Jacque's Cabaret were to be improved, the police were to stop harassing gay men, and ordinances banning same-sex dancing were to be repealed. The parade ended with a closet-smashing ceremony, demonstrating a refusal to go back into hiding. 


# Pride In The Present

As Boston's Pride events grew larger and larger, weathering the AIDs epidemic of the 1980s, their pressure became hard to ignore. The state’s first LGBT politicians (Elaine Noble and Barney Frank) were frequent guests of the marches, policy pushes became more focused, and the open nature of the Marches created an environment far friendlier to LGBT people than ever before. The Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled in 2003 that same-sex couples had the right to marry, becoming the first state in the US to fully recognize same-sex marriage. 

Today, Massachusetts has the second highest percentage of LGBT people (relative to population) of the United States, and Boston’s yearly Pride celebration is the third largest in the country. Boston may not have invented Pride, but city’s network of activists and organizers - much like those men and women with whom the first Pride demonstration share an anniversary - worked to create a world that enriched them with the rights they sorely lacked. 


Future Boston Pride Marches would have shifting political goals and marching paths, but would always grow larger and prouder year after year. In 1975 the Boston Globe reported up to 8,000 marchers in that year’s Pride Parade; in 1986, they reported more than triple that number. The movement grew both in Boston and in the country at large. Dallas and Milwaukee hosted their first Pride Marches in 1971, with cities across the world joining them.
